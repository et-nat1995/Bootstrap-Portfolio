                            Hi, My name is Tamir Natanov, I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I started programing when I
                            was in highschool, but never really concidered software development as a career choice
                            until later on. After highschool I took a year off from heavy schooling to figure out what
                            exactly I would like to pursue, figure out who I am and what I like. Halfway through that
                            year my parents and i decided to move Israel, still unsure what im doing, I said yes. Let
                            move! I did this to get out of my comfort zone, to leave everything that I had and start
                            life new in a different counrty, state, city. What a better way to move on in life? During
                            my time in Israel I came to a conclusion that I want to pursue a career in the High-Tech
                            industry, Programing. I got accepted into a Bachloers Of Science Degree in Computer Science
                            at <a href="https://www.hit.ac.il/en" target="_blank"> The Holon Instute of Technolgy</a>.
                            Toward the end of my first year of three, my father passed away due to sickness. After my
                            father passed away, my mother and I needed to leave, we needed a change. We decided to move
                            to Phoenix. Moving here I wished to conitnue my degree, but the process to transfer all my
                            credits from Israel would take too long. I waited out for a while, but nothing happened. I
                            went back to school taking general classes with some programing classes, which I was told
                            would transfer to ASU, but at the end of the semester, that wasn't the case. At this point
                            I enrolled in Universty of Arizona Full-Stack bootcamp!! Best desicion I made.
